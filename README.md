# Undirected Graph with Breadth-First Search (BFS)
A simple simulator and visualizer for a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on an undirected graph. Built as a web application. Developed as Major Course Output #1 for DLSU CSINTSY course (T3 2022-2023).

## Running the web app
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` on any modern browser.

## Using the web app
This web app simulates an undirected graph, from which the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm can be performed and demonstrated. Each node is represented by an integer, and this integer value can be used to designate the start node and target node for the algorithm.

Pressing the `Perform BFS` button will start the algortihm using the given values.

Furthermore, additional nodes may be added, and existing ones may be removed, using the designated fields below the `Perform BFS` button. Similarly, additional edges may be added, and existing edges may be removed, using their own fields located below.

## Notes
- Most of the HTML and CSS code used by this web app can be found inside the variable `htmlCode` inside the file `script.js`. 
- This web app uses elementary HTML/CSS structures, shapes, and graphics to create the visualizer. They may or may not work on older browsers.
- For optimal page layout, set the website zoom level to 100%.
